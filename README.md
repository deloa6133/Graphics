To view running project files, all files must be within the same directory.
Once all files are contained within the same directory, open the index.html file in a browser of your choosing (tested in Firefox).

Select any project to view. Sliders and radio buttons may be manipulated to view full operation.

Special considerations: Project 2 allows the user to select and drag the screen to rotate the view of the perspective.
